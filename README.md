# Automation using Nodemcu

This is a automation project using Nodemcu wifi enabled micro-controller using the Blynk framework.

I made this project to learn about IOT,automation and micro-controllers.

### Features:

- Controlling electronic devices using relays that can be switched ON/OFF using the app
- It uses **DHT11**  sensor to send real-time temperature and humidity to the app.
- Has an indicator LED to show that it is connected to the server or not
